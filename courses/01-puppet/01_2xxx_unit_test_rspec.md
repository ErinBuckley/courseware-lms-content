### slide 2 Introductory stuff
"Puppet is written in Ruby. And so it works very well to test your Puppet modules with a Ruby tool. In the Ruby world, there are several testing libraries that you can use to test your Puppet modules. rspec is a popular one and one that we use extensively at Puppet Labs."  


### slide The Basics
You can use rspec to encapsulate what your testing with the `describe` blockn and `content`. IN a general unit testing sense, you use `describe` to describe the behavior of a class. For example:

    @@@Puppet
    describe Hash do
    end
