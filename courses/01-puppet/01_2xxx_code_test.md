# Validating your Puppet Code

Before testing to see whether your manifest and modules are delivering the results that you expect, you need to validate your Puppet code syntax and check that you have followed established style conventions.  In this course we look at the first level of testing, validating your Puppet code, using the Puppet Language Style Guide, Puppet parser, and puppet lint.

At the end of this course you will be able to:

* Access the Puppet Language Style Guide. 
* Use Puppet parser to validate Puppet code syntax.
* Install puppet-lint.
* Use puppet-lint to compare your manifests to established coding standards.

### slide Automate

Puppet is about automating the management of your IT infrastructure, large or small, simple or complex. And Puppet is especially concerned with managing the entire life cycle of your infrastructure, fixing or updating configuration files and automatically restarting services. But all of this only works if your modules are written correctly, which proper testing can ensure. We have a number of tools and frameworks available to help you test your modules. But first, a brief review of Puppet's structure and some best practices for writing Puppet modules.
