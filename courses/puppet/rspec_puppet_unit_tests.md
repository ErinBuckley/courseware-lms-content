### slide 1 - Testing Puppet: Unit Tests

Unit tests let you test parts of a complete configuration, in isolation from one another and in a controlled context, so that you can identify exactly what pieces may be not working and under what conditions.  Your unit tests should be as simple as possible and easy to debug. They should test the smallest unit of functionality and are intended to prove that each part of your code can work on its own as intended and independent of the other pieces.
